#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of computer science that deals with developing,designing,testing and maintance of software

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1)High-Level Programming Languages (1950s-1960s): The development of languages like Fortran and Lisp enabled more efficient, human-readable code, moving away from machine-level programming.

2)Structured Programming (1970s): The adoption of structured programming techniques emphasized clean, readable code and logical control flow, reducing errors and improving maintainability.

3)Agile Methodologies (2001): The Agile Manifesto introduced iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility, transforming software development into a more adaptive, customer-driven process.





List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

software development life cycle are:
Requirement Gathering: Identify and document the software's objectives and user needs.

System Design: Plan the software architecture, components, and technologies.

Implementation (Coding): Write the actual code based on the design.

Testing: Identify and fix bugs, ensuring the software meets requirements.

Deployment: Release the software to the production environment or users.

Maintenance: Provide ongoing updates, fixes, and improvements post-release.





Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall: A linear, sequential approach with fixed phases (like Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment). Best for projects with clear, stable requirements — e.g., setting up a computer lab network.

Agile: An iterative, flexible approach with frequent feedback and evolving development cycles (sprints). Ideal for projects with changing needs — e.g., developing a mobile app with ongoing user input.










Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer: Writes, tests, and maintains code based on project requirements. Translates design into functional software and fixes bugs.

Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing test plans, running tests, identifying bugs, and verifying fixes.

Project Manager: Oversees project planning, tracks progress, manages timelines, resources, and ensures team collaboration and goal alignment.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
challenges faced and strategies to overcome these challanges are:

Unclear Requirements: Clarify through regular meetings and documentation.
Tight Deadlines: Prioritize tasks and use Agile methods.
Debugging Issues: Use systematic tools, logs, and unit tests.
Keeping Up with Tech: Take courses and practice new skills.
Team Communication: Use collaboration tools and daily check-ins.








Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
There importance are :
Unit Testing: Tests individual components or functions to ensure they work as expected. Helps catch bugs early and ensures code reliability.

Integration Testing: Verifies that different modules or services work well together. Ensures smooth interaction between system parts.

System Testing: Tests the entire system end-to-end to check if it meets overall requirements. Validates performance, security, and functionality.

Acceptance Testing: Confirms the software meets user needs and business requirements. Ensures readiness for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering: The practice of designing and refining input prompts to guide AI models in generating accurate, relevant, and useful responses.

Importance:

Improves Accuracy: Clear prompts help AI understand context better.
Enhances Efficiency: Well-structured prompts reduce the need for follow-up clarifications.
Tailors Output: Specific prompts shape responses to meet user needs and expectations.
Solves Complex Problems: Creative prompting can help AI generate detailed, insightful, and nuanced outputs.








Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: its  all  about databases."
Problem: Too broad — it doesn’t specify what kind of information is needed (types, uses, structure, etc.).

Improved Prompt: "Explain the difference between relational and non-relational databases with examples."
Why it’s better: It’s clear, specific, and focused on a particular aspect of databases, making it easier for the AI to provide a relevant and detailed response
